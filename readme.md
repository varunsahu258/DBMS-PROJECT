## 🧹 Normalization

All relations are normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to ensure data redundancy is minimized and consistency is maintained.

---

## 🧾 SQL Queries

A set of optimized SQL queries are written to:

- Retrieve daily milk records
- Generate farmer payment reports
- Track milk storage
- Analyze sales and expenses

---

## 📊 Visualizations

Data visualizations are created to showcase:

- Milk collection trends
- Farmer-wise contribution
- Payment history
- Profit/loss analysis

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Import the SQL dump file into a MySQL server.
3. Use any MySQL-compatible client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin) to run and test queries.
4. Refer to the documentation folder for detailed instructions.
